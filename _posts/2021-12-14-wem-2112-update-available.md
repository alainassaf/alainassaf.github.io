<h3 id="privilege-elevation">Privilege elevation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This release introduces the privilege elevation feature. The feature lets you elevate the privileges of non-administrative users to an administrator level necessary for some executables. As a result, those users can start those executables as if they are members of the administrators group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can configure privilege elevation using two types of rules: executable rules and Windows installer rules. You can configure how a rule behaves according to the type of the operating system. You can also configure whether a rule takes effect at a particular point in time or within a time range. You assign a rule on a per user or per user group basis.</p>

<p>For more information, see Privilege elevation. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/current-release/user-interface-description/security.html#privilege-elevation">Privilege elevation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-optimizing-multi-session-os-machines">Support for optimizing multi-session OS machines</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Multi-session OS machines are used to run multiple sessions from a single machine to deliver desktops and applications to users. A disconnected session remains active and its applications continue to run. The disconnected session can consume resources needed for connected desktops and applications that run on the same machine. With this feature, you can optimize multi-session OS machines where disconnected sessions are present. The feature improves the user experience of connected sessions by limiting the number of resources disconnected sessions can consume. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/current-release/user-interface-description/system-optimization/multi-session-optimization.html">Multi-session Optimization</a>.</p>
