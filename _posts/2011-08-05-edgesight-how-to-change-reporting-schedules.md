<strong>Intro</strong>

EdgeSight allows you to schedule any of its reports for automatic running and delivery to either a file share or e-mail address(es).  Did you know that you can modify when these reports are run?  I will show you in this post where to find the reporting schedules and how to modify when they run.

<strong>EdgeSight Console: Configure Tab</strong>

Open your EdgeSight Console and click on the Configure Tab

<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/assets/img/edgesight-how-to-change-reporting-schedules/image.png" width="644" height="112" alt="image">

On the left-hand-side, under Server Configuration, click Reporting Services and then Schedules

<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/assets/img/edgesight-how-to-change-reporting-schedules/image1.png" width="243" height="153" alt="image1">

You will now see the built-in schedules and when they run in EdgeSight

<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/assets/img/edgesight-how-to-change-reporting-schedules/image2.png" width="644" height="265" alt="image2">

Simply click on the Edit button and change the schedule to suit your purposes.  You can also create your own schedules here depending on your needs.

<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/assets/img/edgesight-how-to-change-reporting-schedules/image3.png" width="644" height="303" alt="image3">

As always, I welcome all comments and questions especially about EdgeSight.
