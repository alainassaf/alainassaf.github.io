When you use AppSense Environment Manager you will notice a splash screen that displays on logoff with the following text:
<blockquote><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:small;"><strong>Environment Manager actions in progress. Please wait while logoff completes..</strong></span></blockquote>
To remove this text, you open the Environment Manager Console and load your current EM configuration.

Click on the Lockdown Tab

<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/assets/img/appsense-hide-em-logoff-splash-screen/image.png" width="386" height="134" alt="image">

Click on the Blocked Message Library Tab

<img 
    style="display: block; 
           margin-left: auto;
           margin-right: auto;"
    src="/assets/img/appsense-hide-em-logoff-splash-screen/image1.png" width="434" height="387" alt="image1">

Delete the Message column and it will no longer display.
