I just received word from Feedspot that they chose to include WagtheReal in their list of [**Top 50 PowerShell Blogs**](http://blog.feedspot.com/powershell_blogs/) on the web. 

I'm very humbled, and while PowerShell was not the main focus of my blog, I increasingly turn to it to manage Windows and Citrix environments. I think it's one of the most important pieces of technology that a Windows and Citrix administrator should learn and I hope that my PowerShell focus posts will continue to be informative to my readers.
