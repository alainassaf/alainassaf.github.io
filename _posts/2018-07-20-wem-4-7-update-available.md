<h1>Intro</h1>
Summer is time for vacations, beaches, and WEM Upgrades! Citrix has released version 4.7 of WEM. You can now download the new version <a href="https://www.citrix.com/downloads/xenapp-and-xendesktop/components/workspace-environment-management-47.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (requires Platinum licenses and login to Citrix.com). I’ve provided the release notes below.

<div class="richtext base section"></div>
Workspace Environment Management 4.7 includes the following new features. For information about bug fixes, see <a href="https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/current-release/fixed-issues.html">Fixed issues</a>.
<h3 id="new-wemdatabase-powershell-cmdlet-updated">New-wemDatabase PowerShell cmdlet updated</h3>
PowerShell modules in the Workspace Environment Management SDK are updated at this release. A new parameter CommandTimeout is provided for the <strong>New-wemDatabase</strong> cmdlet which allows you to configure timeout period for connection attempts to the WEM database. After the timeout period an error message is displayed. The default timeout is 300 seconds.

The <a href="https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/workspace-environment-management-sdk/en/latest/">Workspace Environment Management SDK documentation</a> is updated to version 4.7.
