## [Successfully Migrating Users to Virtual Desktops](http://web.archive.org/web/20100327173342/http://community.citrix.com/display/ocb/2009/08/04/Successfully+Migrating+Users+to+Virtual+Desktops)

"Once organizations have determined to implement a virtual desktop solution, and the environment has been designed to align with business and user requirements, users must be seamlessly migrated from their physical endpoints to their new virtual desktop. Ideally, users should be unaware their desktop is now virtual. Without building a proper environment and migration plan, users will be forced to learn a new system, reconfigure their application settings, and re-build their personal environment.

This TechTalk focuses on the process, options and recommendations for successfully migrating users from their physical endpoints to virtual desktops."

## [Designing an Enterprise VDI Architecture with XenDesktop](http://web.archive.org/web/20100327173631/http://community.citrix.com/display/ocb/2009/08/04/Designing+an+Enterprise+VDI+Architecture+with+XenDesktop)

"When an organization identifies the need for a VDI solution, infrastructure architecture must be carefully designed. Virtualizing a user's physical desktop and migrating the image into the data center will provide a VDI solution, but requires different management, maintenance, and support from a local desktop to meet the needs of the users.

This TechTalk focuses on the core design decisions that impacts the overall virtual desktop design. These decision areas include understanding the users, organizational layout, current organizational infrastructure."

## [Virtual Desktops or Virtual Applications - Your Best Solution](http://web.archive.org/web/20100327173039/http://community.citrix.com/display/ocb/2009/08/04/Virtual+Desktops+or+Virtual+Applications+-+Your+Best+Solution)

"Everyone uses a desktop device, regardless if they are running virtualized applications on XenApp, web-based applications or locally installed applications. While virtual desktops are all the rage in IT, many organizations are trying to figure out where VDI fits within their infrastructure. Some organizations are following an all-or-nothing route where every user is converted to a virtual desktops but many others are trying to align the VDI solution to specific user requirements. When does a user need a full-blown virtual desktop vs. a desktop appliance vs. an offline desktop?

This TechTalk, which is part 1 in a 3-part series, will look at understanding and identifying how organizations should align their users with the correct desktop solution."
