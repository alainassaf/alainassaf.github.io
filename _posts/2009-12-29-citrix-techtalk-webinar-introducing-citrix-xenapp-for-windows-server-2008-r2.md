I would strongly recommend that you try to attend this upcoming Citrix TechTalk Webinar about "Parra" or XenApp for 2008 R2.  I've seen a previous one and I'm very impressed.  A fully integrated management console (with Active Directory/GPO editing), PowerShell cmdlets, and full App-V (MS Application Virtualization/Softgrid) support.  Webinar details below:

<strong>Citrix TechTalk Webinar: Introducing Citrix XenApp for Windows Server 2008 R2- </strong>

Many organizations have begun evaluating and migrating to the Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 platform. In response, on December 14th Citrix released a public technology preview for XenApp on the R2 platform. This public preview will enable customers to evaluate new technologies and features coming in the next release of XenApp and prepare for adoption when the final is released.

Come learn about these exciting new XenApp features available for this new platform from Citrix Systems, Product Manager Sridhar Mullapudi.

In this session you'll learn about:
<ul>
	<li>New enterprise-class management features like a single management console with seamless integration with Active Directory group policies, simplified role based install and PowerShell SDK</li>
