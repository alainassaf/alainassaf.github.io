<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’ve been a Citrix customer or partner for a while, you’ll notice new names in our products and in this product documentation. If you’re new to this Citrix product, you might see different names for a product or component.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new product and component names stem from the expanding Citrix portfolio and cloud strategy. Articles in this product documentation use the following names:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops:</strong>&nbsp;Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops offers a virtual app and desktop solution, provided as a cloud service and as an on-premises product, giving employees the freedom to work from anywhere on any device while cutting IT costs.

<p>Here’s a quick recap:</p>

<!-- wp:table -->
<table class="wp-block-table"><thead><tr><th>Is</th><th>Was</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops</td><td>XenApp and XenDesktop</td></tr><tr><td>Citrix Workspace app</td><td>Citrix Receiver</td></tr><tr><td>Citrix Provisioning</td><td>Provisioning Services</td></tr></tbody></table>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Implementing this transition in our products and their documentation is an ongoing process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>In-product content might still contain former names. For example, you might see instances of earlier names in console text, messages, and directory/file names.</li><li>It is possible that some items (such as commands and MSIs) might continue to retain their former names to prevent breaking existing customer scripts.</li><li>Related product documentation and other resources (such as videos and blog posts) that are linked from this product’s documentation might still contain former names.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your patience during this transition is appreciated. For more detail about our new names, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citrix.com/about/citrix-product-guide/">https://www.citrix.com/about/citrix-product-guide/</a>.<br />

<h3 id="new-product-and-component-version-numbers">New product and component version numbers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this release, product and component version numbers are displayed in the format:&nbsp;<strong><em>YYMM.c.m.b</em></strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>YYMM</em>&nbsp;= Year and month when the features are finalized. For example, if the features are finalized in August, a release in September 2018 appears as 1808.</li><li><em>c</em>&nbsp;= Maintenance version (if applicable).</li><li><em>m</em>&nbsp;= Citrix Cloud release number for the month.</li><li><em>b</em>&nbsp;= Build number. This field is shown only on the About page of the product, and in the OS’s feature for removing or changing programs.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example,&nbsp;<strong>Workspace Environment Management 1808.0.1</strong>&nbsp;indicates that the released product with features finalized in August 2018 is associated with Citrix Cloud release 1 in that month, and is not a maintenance version. Some UI elements display only the version’s year and month, for example,&nbsp;<strong>Workspace Environment Management 1808</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In earlier releases of this product (Workspace Environment Management 4.7 and earlier), version numbers were displayed in the format: 4.version, where the version value incremented by one for each release. For example, the release following 4.6 was 4.7. Those earlier releases will not be updated with the new numbering format.<br /></p>
