Do yourself a favor and read John Smith's post on the (then) new [Citrix Netscaler VPX](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/deploying-vpx.html).

John has written a great article detailing how the Netscaler VPX is a real game changer and how to set it up in your own lab via a UtipU video.
