Out since late May of this year, Citrix XenApp Power and Capacity Management Technology is currently available as a tech preview [**here**](https://xenappblog.com/2009/citrix-xenapp-power-and-capacity-management-technology-preview/#:~:text=Citrix%20just%20released%20the%20Technology%20Preview%20of%20the,scaling%20down%20the%20number%20of%20online%20XenApp%20servers.).  

**iForum 2009** in Melbourne just finished and they demonstrated this technology in the closing keynote.  The use of this technology can really make a difference in your bottom line in terms of power and cooling savings.  It is a rethinking of XenApp's mature load balancing technology and is another way of looking at server utilization (which was much of the argument for moving towards server virtualization a few years ago).   This product, combined with [**Provisioning Server**](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/provisioning/), is perfect for the environment I manage.  

Our farm is over-built in anticipation of an event that would force most employees to telework, so our servers are typically underutilized.  Check out the video below.
