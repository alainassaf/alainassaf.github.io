It's that time again! No not Valentines Day! It's time for the 2018 State of VDI/SBC Union Survey. <a href="https://vdilikeapro.com/ruben-spruijt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruben Spruijt</a> and <a href="https://vdilikeapro.com/mark-plettenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Plettenberg</a> continue to drive one of the EUC industry's largest and most valuable surveys. I encourage you to participate in this survey because it benefits all of us who deploy and manage EUC solutions.
