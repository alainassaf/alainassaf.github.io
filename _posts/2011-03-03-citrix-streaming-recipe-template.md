I recently changed jobs and they use Citrix Application Streaming to package applications.  In my previous job we used Microsoft App-V and had great success with it.  One of the cornerstones of that success was (that thorn in the sides of many a system administrator/engineer) documentation.

Softgrid (and then Microsoft) provided a basic template that documented the steps to sequence an application.  Since then, many individuals and companies have provided their own version of this document.  Since I had never used Citrix Application Streaming, I wanted to find a template to work from and document my first application.  I failed to find anything (please suggest any in the comments section below), but did stumble upon [**www.kirx.org**](http://www.kirx.org){:target="_blank"}, written by [**Falko Gräfe**](http://www.kirx.org/about-en.html){:target="_blank"}.  Falko has created one of the most complete and detailed App-V sequencing templates I’ve seen.  You can get it [**here**](http://www.kirx.org/app-v/use/kirx-resources-en.html){:target="_blank"}

I used this template for my own purposes and modified it to use with Citrix Application Streaming.  Please offer any feedback in the comments section, so we can improve the template.
