### Hello,


I'm a technology professional who's worked in IT for over 20 years. For much of that time, I've focused in virtualization platforms from Citrix, VMware, and Microsoft and several related technologies to automate, monitor, and manage the enduser experience. I've worked in many diverse environments such as architecture, small business, manufacturing/distribution, medical (hospital and medical devices), government (federal), and industrial (chemical and electronics) all with an IT focus.

I now work in North Carolina for the second largest credit union in the USA.

I'm currently a [**Citrix Certified Expert in Virtualization**](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/078f2551-8cd9-41c9-bba6-453b8400b18e){:target="_blank"} which also includes the [**Citrix Professional**](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/52d95745-96c1-4c32-a1e6-98f901536433){:target="_blank"} and the [**Citrix Associate**](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f64c03e7-8371-4ac5-bf55-409f402d23ca){:target="_blank"} certifications. In addition, I also have [**CompTia's Network+**](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/d8f50606-7cff-456a-ad30-7b2f95f883df){:target="_blank"}.

In September 2017, I was inducted into the [**Citrix Technology Advocates Program**](https://www.citrix.com/community/cta/){:target="_blank"}. I've been renewed in this terrific program in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Also in September 2017, my first blog: [**Wagthereal.com**](https://wagthereal.com){:target="_blank"} was included in [**Feedspot's Top 50 PowerShell Blogs And Websites For Developers**](http://blog.feedspot.com/powershell_blogs/){:target="_blank"} 

In June 2018, I became a leader of the Raleigh-Durham Citrix User Group.
